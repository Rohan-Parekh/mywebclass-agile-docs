AAs a teacher, I want to be able to easily access and download instructional resources, such as lesson plans, assignments, and assessments, from the Mywebclass.org documentation page, so that I can use them in my own courses.



Acceptance Criteria:


The instructional resources are organized and labeled in a clear and logical manner, so that teachers can easily find what they are looking for.
The resources are available in a variety of formats, such as PDFs, Word documents, and PowerPoint presentations, to accommodate different teaching styles and preferences.
The resources are regularly updated and reviewed to ensure that they are accurate and relevant to current course content and teaching standards.
